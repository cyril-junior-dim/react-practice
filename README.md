This repository is dedicated to tracking my frontend development practice. I am pursuing a best-selling course on Udemy, "The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More" under Senior Developer Jonas Schmedtmann. In this repository, I will post solutions demonstrating my growth as I:

- Become an advanced, confident, and modern React developer from scratch

- Master the confusing but important useEffect hook once and for all
- Build many custom hooks, reusable in your future projects
- Build single-page applications with React Router (including v6.4+ with data loading)

- Understand how React actually works behind the scenes: virtual DOM, reconciliation, fiber tree, key prop, etc.
- Style my apps with Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, Styled Components (CSS-in-JS)
- Practice my skills with many challenges, exercises, and practice projects

The course will address critical talking points of React, including:
